# Gmail Cleaner

A project to automate gmail inbox cleanup.

Inspired by [inboxbot](https://github.com/paulfurley/inboxbot).

Distinction is that I really just want to remove the inbox label to archive the
mail, and/or eventually apply other labels via rules.

Why not just use Gmail's filters? Gmail doesn't provide time based filters, it
only does filtering on new email ingestion.
